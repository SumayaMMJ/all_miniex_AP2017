**Added function**

A slider that controls the FrameRate value. I set the parameters for the slider, I also changed a few values in Daniel Shiffmans sketch, on how fast the rain is supposed to fall when the slider is untouched. 
Although I now realize that it might be a bit pointless as you can change the FrameRate with the slider anyway...
I thought of making a slider, because when I was playing around with the syntax for the yspeed(speed of the raindrops), I found the rain looked a bit more realistic when going a bit faster than the original setting. But then the slower setting made it look more beautiful as well somehow. So I wanted the user to be able to play around with the FrameRate setting, to find their preferred speed.

**Difficulty of this weeks miniex**

The challenge was in understanding Daniel Shiffmans code so I could write it down in a Flowchart, and then finding out what kind of function or syntax I should add.
By using the Flowchart I got an easier visualization of how the code was executed.

**How may we see, organize and communicate things differently by using a flow chart?**

It's another way to analyze/understand someones code, and through that be able to consider different things in the code that could be changed or should be added.
The Flowchart can also be used for debugging, as well as an easier understanding for none programmers to know what the step-by-step actions in the code are.
So by using a FlowChart you can better discuss your program with someone who can't read code.
