##Description##
With my sketch, you can change the verb/adverb, in the first two lines in the chorus from the song "Never gonna give you up" by Rick Astley.
What I wanted to try was change the meaning of this song, which had become an iconic meme, used in a way to get on people’s nerves by deceiving them; Rickrolling. 
By being able to change the 2 words in the lyrics it could change the feeling when listening to the song, making it refreshing perhaps. What I’m trying to say is, I tried to make it less frustrating when listening to the song.

My initial idea was to have the whole chorus in my sketch, and be able to change each rhyming word to make a song with a complete new meaning.
However, I barely got it to work with one line from the chorus so I kept it as it is. And as for being able to change them individually, I didn’t figure that out either.
I struggled a lot just trying to get a single word to change each time the mouse is clicked (as commented in my code). Although it looks plain I hope the message I tried to make got through.

**RiTa functions used**
I used the removeWord() and randomWord() function to be able to remove the word in the line, and then change it with a random verb by writing randomWord("vb").
And I removed the word by referring to the word in the array: removeWord("give");

##Can you describe your experience in working with found text as the source materials?##
Having something to work with that everyone knows about makes it easier, as I don’t have to explain why this song could possibly bring frustration to some listeners.
Therefor my explanation might be unneeded.

##How might we think about the materiality of text/interface? How might we understand the “textual character” of the found text? ##
Digital media and printed text is different concerning what you can do with the two separate mediums. Digitally you might have unlimited ways of transforming your text to convey your point, compared to the printed text.
But when it comes to text in the digital interface and the printed text, we have a difference in how we perceive the two.
The digital medium challenges our notion of materiality, as we are used to being able to feel and hear the paper when we turn the page, compared to swiping on a tablet.
Being able to feel a book, knowing exactly how many pages there are by sight, these elements are lost in the digital medium.
Our thoughts on "real" materiality being the printed text, makes it harder to accept the materiality of the digital text.
