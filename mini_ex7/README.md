My program is suppossed to be leading the user on, in to thinking that something is awaiting, an event as a result of clicking on the buttons.
By giving the user the initial impression of some sort of reward for clicking on the buttons marked with exclamation marks (the form of the buttons are also positioned in the form of an exclamation mark, to help lead this impression).

This program was my initial idea, but i had another idea were you clicked on a button which created a new button at a random place.
However, I later thought about what the point of that program would even be and I came up with no good explanation. And I also couldn't make it execute the random placed buttons, or else I would have to button in every position for each button, as I did with this program I have here.

In short, I went back to my initial idea, because it made more sense to me and I was able to code it. 


**What are the advantages in using objects and what might be the limitations? What's your experience in using objects?**

Being able to group something in to a CLASS is a lot more useful when you have to use a function multiple times. 
I actually used this in my other idea, although I had some complications with making it keep creating new buttons(and that's probably not a limitation but just my incompetence to understand what I did wrong).

In my opinion using objects makes it easier structure wise, as in, my code isn't extremely long. So it's a good use for shortening my code.
In that sense there's also more order in my code, and someone reading it would have an easier time following it when for example refer to "button.display();", then they know i'm referring to the "display" function.
