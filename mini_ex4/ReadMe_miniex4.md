##Description##

This is a feedback loop in the form of a circle that moves from one side of the canvas to the other, and each time it touches the edge the color changes!
The color change is my way of showing the feedback of the circle touching the edge of the canvas.

I struggled with the color change for each time the circle touches the edge of the canvas. I thought I should follow the random function in the fill(), but that only made it change every time you loaded the page.
I then looked at how my classmates had done it in previous miniex, but most of what i found didnt work for me. I tried naming my own functions but I found a video by Daniel Shiffmann on using the random() function and i tried applying what he did to my own sketch, and it worked!
