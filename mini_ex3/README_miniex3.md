Link to my "is it loading or not???" throbber -> https://rawgit.com/SumayaMMJ/all_miniex_AP2017/master/mini_ex3/index.html

##Description##

I made this throbber to resemble a clock. However I intentionally didn't make the hands on the clock move. The circle that rotates is to resemble the clock ticking with the expectation that something is soon to come (fx the hands moving), but nothing happens. Usually when you see a throbber you are expectant of the data that is loading, but in the case of this throbber I tried to express the feeling you get when you're waiting for a long time and nothing happens. Basically the feeling that you're wasting time.

I used the push() and pop() functions to easily navigate the canvas, thus having an easier time finding the center of the canvas and working from there. 
I tried many times to insert an image via the preload() function and createImage(), however neither worked for me. All I get is a blank page with the word "Loading..." in the upper left corner. Sometimes it says something about not having access due to "null" when I check for an error in the "developer tool" --> "console". I think it might be because Chrome has restrictions on using files from their web in your code or something, all I know is that I was denied access. 

##How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?##

This throbber I made could reflect the impatience that comes with being online and having access to the Internet. Being met with a throbber for a longer period of 3-5seconds will cause frustrations to many, and either make them close the tab or make them double-click again thinking it might quicken the process. The throbber is also a way of bringing you back to reality for a few seconds as it makes you wait, fx when you watch a video and it buffers thus abruptly separating you from the world you were immersed in. This happens without the users consent and is therefore a cause of frustration.
