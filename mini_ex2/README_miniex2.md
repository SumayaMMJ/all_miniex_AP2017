**Coding Process**
I wanted to make an error/glitch in which one element didn't match the other elements, thus making it stand out.
In my process I made the 3 static rect() pretty easily but I had some trouble with finding the exact placement on the coordinate of the canvas. So I just tried writing different numbers untill I got it.

The most troubling was getting the glitch rect() to work when you moved the mouse. I later found out it was because that the function mouseMoved() was supposed to be after function draw(). 
I originally wanted it to continously display an array of colours that overlap to make it look more "glithy", but I never really found out how. 

**What is Error to me?**
To me an error is a mistake that wasn't supposed to happen, that means it could have been prevented. 
So when you use the word "error" to describe something, it is usually not something that was intentionally done.
