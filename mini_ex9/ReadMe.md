I Used the Open Weather API

You can manually input af city name to see the temperature.

The temperature is measured in celsius and has been devided in 4 colors:

Blue: under 5

Yellow: 6 - 14

Orange: 15 - 25

Red: above 26

I followed Daniel Shiffmanns Videos quite a lot and used Winnies code as well for inspiration on deviding the url in parts, to later put them together in a string.

I had other ideas I wanted to try using the New York Times API, where you could input a word in a submit box like in this program, and then have the world visualized in circles on the screen based on the amount of hits.
But then I realized it was almost basically the same as Winnies program so I scratched the program even though I was pretty far in the process (though I also stumbled upon some troubles with the circles on screen, which made me reconsider how they should be presented).
