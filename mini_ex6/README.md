**Description**

It’s supposed to look like ripples in water, appearing because of rain or something else. The ripples will expand and create some overlapped pattern of lines.
When you see a pattern that could be to your liking you can click on the screen and freeze them. And right there you’ve generated a pattern to print on stickers, clothes, or anything really - that was the idea behind it.
I wanted to go a step further and be give the user the ability to click on random places to make new ripples, however it didn’t work out.
Also, you can’t unpause the ripple when you freeze them. Sadly, I didn’t couldn’t make it work.

**Rules applied**

1) I have on line 16 and 20 a rule that makes ripples appear at random places, at a random size, by using a for loop.
2) Another for loop was used in line 31 to generate the ripples.
3) In line 37 I made the "if" statement, that makes the ripples freeze if mouse is pressed.

**Generativity**

My work has "if" statements and "for loops", which combined with the "random" function should create different patterned ripple every time.
However, as I, the author of this work, made sure it the size of the ripples don’t exceed "width/2" or "height/2", at their starting point, I have thus limited some potential patterns in my system.
In my opinion the system here is not autonomous, in the sense that I set certain parameters that could potentially limit some patterns from being created.
